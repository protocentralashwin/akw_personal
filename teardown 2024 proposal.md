From making an open source patient monitor to making it wearable: The HealthyPi Story

Teaser

This talk would tell the story of HealthyPi, an open source patient monitor concept that we made, and how it evolved to the HealthyPi Move, a wearable monitor that can be used for continuous monitoring of vital signs, and  also everything in between. The talk would cover the challenges faced in making a wearable device, the design decisions that went into making HealthyPi, and the lessons learned along the way. The talk would also cover the open source hardware and software that went into and came out of making HealthyPi, and how it can be used to make other medical devices too.
